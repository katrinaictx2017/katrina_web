        <p>After abandoning earth before the whole earth got destroyed by the galactic alien war in year 2045. 
        The remaining human race escapes to space as they try to find a new home. For a few years the humans have been
        living in a spaceship called the "White Whale" and during their time there they have been making and improving their new
        habitat unit called "New Los angeles" until one day they are suddenly attacked by an unknown group of aliens. The 
        humans ran away from the unknown aliens and had barely escaped. Now, with the Lifehold damaged and unable to
        continue flying any longer, the humans have no choice but to land to a near by planet. The humans crash
        in a nearby planet called planet "Mira". Arriving in this new planet, the humans face new trials
        and troubles, how will they be able to adapt to this new planet?</p>

        Xenoblade Chronicles X is the game that I have
        been playing most recently. It's a game where the main goal and focus is exploration.
        you explore to gather data, materials, and kill mosters as you travel through,
        the lands of mira. There is a lot to cover in planet Mira, as you have to explore
        5 different continents; Primordia,Noctilum,Oblivia,Sylvalum, and Claudros. In this website I will
        be showing you what the environment is like in these unique lands and what happens there.
