        <p> In this page I will be talking about how I discovered my love for minature models.<br> So these days I've been attending an afterschool program called the Emily Carr <br> Headstart in art District program.</p>
        <p>We are currently on our final project. For my first two projects we did:
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li> Shading still life objects</li>
                <li> Study of human anatomy</li>
            </ol>
            <p>And for our third project we are now doing space in 3D. Basically we look for scratches marks ar anything that looks strange around us, take a picture as evidence create a story about how that mark happened and make a model for the setting.
                Our teacher said we could do our models with paper, clay or pretty<br> much anything.</p>
            <p> Now I barley have any expereince with 3d models, so I went to pinterest for some inspiration.<br>
                <p></p>

                <p>I found these pictures of 3d minature models and wanted to do something similar to these.<br> I decide to make a minature 3d model of moffit park.I did not created the whole thing<br> though I cropped out a part of the park. </p>
                <p>So I watched some tutorials at youtube and became facinated and excited about making it. And after that I bought the supplies to create my model (they were pretty expensive).

                    <br> I am creating the model right now and it's really fun. I kind of feel like when god created the universe he created this and that, it's like I sand box game where I create things how I want and mabye that's why I'm having fun.
                    I had three weeks to make this, so here what I did.</p>

                <table border=1 cell padding=2>

                    <tr>
                        <td> Week</td>
                        <td align=c enter> What I did</td>

                    </tr>

                    <tr>
                        <td>#1 Nov 5-11</td>
                        <td> I did the storyboard for the evidence.</td>
                    </tr>

                    <tr>
                        <td>#2 Nov 12-18</td>
                        <td> I did some field study at the park like sketches of how the park looked like and started making the model.</td>
                    </tr>

                    <tr>
                        <td>#3 Nov 19-25</td>
                        <td>
                            <p>I continued to create the model. Here's the materials I used to create the model.<br>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>2 6"x11" styrofoam boards</li>
                                    <li> Acrylic paint(brown,yellow,white,black,light green,dark green)</li>
                                    <li>grass texture powder</li>
                                    <li>minature fake trees</li>
                                    <li> masking tape</li>
                                    <li>play-doh clay</li>
                                </ul>
                        </td>

                    </tr>

                </table>

                <p>Once I finish my model I might post a picture of it here.</p>
